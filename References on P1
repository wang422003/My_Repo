outlook: The simplest way is to use the mean value of the gray scale image pixel values. As a rule of thumb, we set the low threshold to 0.66*[mean value] and set the high threshold to 1.33*[mean value]. Another way is to use the median color in the gray scale image and uses 0.66*[median value] and 1.33*[median value] accordingly. For typical images, these two methods achieve comparable results.
